#Devons Tools Post Type API

The purpose of this framework is to make the creation of a post type for use in a plugin much easier. Using this hundreds of lines of code can be saved in post type setup and implementation. 

###Instructions

Do a search-replace accross all files in the pt-API directory and replace MYPLUGIN with your plugins name. This changes various classnames to insure that there is no collisions with other plugins that may happen to use this framework.
